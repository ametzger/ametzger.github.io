Howdy! I'm Alex. I'm a software developer currently working mostly in the .NET stack. I mostly focus on backend development and performance tuning, so that is the main focus of my blog.

I went to [Northeastern University](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/) where I studied Computer Science. I had some [pretty awesome professors](http://eli.barzilay.org) while I was there.

The software I use to blog is [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) with the ubiquitous [Hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde) by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo). It runs on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and you can see the source code [on my GitHub]({{ site.repo }}).
