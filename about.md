Howdy! I'm Alex. I'm a software developer currently working mostly in the .NET stack. I mostly focus on backend development and performance tuning, so that is the main focus of my blog.

The software I use to blog is <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> with the ubiquitous <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde"> Hyde theme</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">Mark Otto</a>. It runs on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and you can see the source code <a href="{{ site.repo }}">here</a>.
